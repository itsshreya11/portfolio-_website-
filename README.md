# ðŸŒŸ Portfolio Website

This is the final task (4/4) of my 1-month internship at Prodigy Infotech. I have created the **Home Page** of my portfolio website using **HTML** and **CSS**.

Due to limited internship duration, I completed only the initial home page design â€” but I plan to finish and improve the entire portfolio soon! ðŸš€

## ðŸ“‚ Features

* Responsive home page layout
* Simple, clean design

## ðŸ“š Future Plans

I will continue developing this project by adding more sections, improving styling, and making it fully dynamic.
